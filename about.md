This is a simple client portal website which allows you and your clients to keep track of the status of projects, and download projects once they're done. This site is built on [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com).

You can view the code for this site at [github.com/jondueck/client](https://github.com/jondueck/client). Currently this code is copyright [Collectif](http://collectif.co), but this may become open source depending on interest.

### Future goals:

- Create a webapp version of this in [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org) or [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com)

---

For the most part, content will be created in posts, but you could use this about page to explain to your client what this site is all about.
